All six knobs are CV-controllable!
### FFT Controls:
- Warp: offset FFT bands (=multiple bins) by a number of bins
- Blur: Change number of bins in each band
- Mix: 0-50%: attenuate the bands between 0-100%.
- Mix: 50-100%: Boost the bands between 100-800% (the waveform is also normalized here not to clip, the result currently is it is a lot more silent in this case)

### Comb filter controls:
- Time: delay time in samples (1-16k)
- Reflect: feedback
- Atmosphere: TiltEQ, clock-wise to hipass, ccw to lowpass

The code could be a lot more optimized! New features could hence be added pretty easily.
